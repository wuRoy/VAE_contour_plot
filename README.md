# VAE_contour_plot
Variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular generative model and has been applied to many different fields. One common routine of these researches is to map a subject (say molecules) to a continuous space and perform optimization/exploration on that. I found illustrating this process is a bit challenging, especially when you want to draw a customized/random 3D surface on a 2D contour. So I wrote this notebook to generate this kind of images. Here you don't need to define a function to polt the 3D surface and contour. You only need to define arrays with indicated pattern and the program will plot it for you. You can also customize image based on your own demands. This is originally made for my group meeting report. Hope will be helpful for you.
